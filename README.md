# RFXCOM2MQTT

[![RFXCOM](rfxcom.png)](http://www.rfxcom.com)

RFXCOM to MQTT bridge for RFXtrx433 devices

All received RFXCOM events are published to the MQTT rfxcom2mqtt/devices/\<id\> topic.
It is up to the MQTT receiver to filter these messages or to have a register/learning/pairing mechanism.

## [Getting started](./docs/README.md)

The [documentation](./docs/README.md) provides you all the information needed to get up and running! Make sure you don't skip sections if this is your first visit, as there might be important details in there for you.

### [Home Assistant Integration](./docs/usage/integrations/home_assistant.md)

The easiest way to integrate Rfxcom2MQTT with Home Assistant is by
using [MQTT discovery](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/mqtt#mqtt-discovery).
This allows Rfxcom2MQTT to automatically add devices to Home Assistant.
